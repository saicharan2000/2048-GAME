# 2048-GAME
This game is mainly based on concept of moving and colliding the same two numbers on 4x4 grid to create a new number which is sum of those two numbers.
when we opened the game , we will have following options to proceed :-
n --> new game
q --> quit
a --> Slide towards Left direction
d --> Right
w --> Up
s --> Down
If atleast numbered block is slided at any direction a new number "2" is generated at a random position.
when we reach atleast one 2048 in our grid ==> "Congrats!! You won the Game".
And if there is no 2048 block in our grid and you are unable to slide on any direction in the grid ==> "GameOver".
